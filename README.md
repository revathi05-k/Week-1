Project Problem Statement :   Traditional farming methods often rely on manual inspection of plant health and soil quality, leading to inaccurate decisions regarding crop selection, fertilizer usage, and irrigation. This results in reduced yield, overuse of chemical fertilizers, and soil degradation.

To promote sustainable agriculture, there is a need for an intelligent system that can automatically detect plant diseases, analyze soil fertility, and recommend suitable crops based on soil and weather conditions.

Therefore, this project aims to develop a Smart Crop Advisor using Deep Learning that utilizes CNN models for plant disease detection and machine learning models for soil fertility classification. Based on the fertility level and weather parameters, the system will provide crop, fertilizer, and water recommendations for sustainable and efficient farming.
Objectives :
- Detect plant diseases using a CNN model trained on leaf images.  
- Analyze soil fertility using a soil dataset (pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium).  
- Suggest suitable crops based on soil and weather conditions.  
- Recommend fertilizer type and water requirements.  
- Deploy as a web application for easy farmer access.
